# Rock-paper-scissor\


🚀 Just created a fun, interactive Snake-Water-Gun game using Python! 🐍💧🔫

This classic game, similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors, is coded with simple logic and loops. It offers an engaging way to practice Python basics, like conditional statements, random module usage, and loops. Excited to continue exploring more fun projects in Python!
